# Git Workflow Standards

> **Role**: Enforces consistent git practices across all projects with version control.

## 1. Session Awareness
- **Start of Session**: When resuming work on a git-tracked project, run `git status` and `git log --oneline -5` to understand the current state before making changes.
- **Dirty State**: If uncommitted changes exist, assess them before proceeding. Do not blindly commit or discard without understanding what they contain.

## 2. Commit Discipline
- **Logical Units**: Commit after completing each logical unit of work (e.g., a bug fix, a feature component, a refactor pass). Do not commit after every file edit, and do not accumulate an entire session's work into a single commit.
- **Convention**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format: `<type>: <description>`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `docs`.
- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should be self-contained. If reverted, only one logical change should be undone.
- **Test Before Commit**: Run the project's test/lint command (e.g., `make test`, `make lint`) before committing. Do not commit code that fails tests.
- **Test Before Push**: `git push` is prohibited unless the project's test runner has been executed in the current session with zero failures. If no test runner exists, explicitly state "no test suite available" in the commit — do not silently skip.

## 3. Branching
- **Direct to Main**: Small, low-risk changes (single-file fixes, config tweaks) go directly to `main`.
- **Feature Branches**: Multi-session features or changes spanning >5 files should use `feature/<name>` branches.
- **Experiment Branches**: Risky or speculative work (architecture changes, reward function variants) should use `experiment/<name>` branches. These may be discarded.
- **Cleanup**: Delete branches after merging. Do not accumulate stale branches.

## 4. Safety
- **No Force Push to Main**: Never `git push --force` on `main`.
- **No Secrets**: Never commit API keys, credentials, or `.env` files. Verify `.gitignore` covers these before the first commit.
- **No Large Binaries**: Never commit model weights (`.pt`, `.pth`), datasets, or files >1 MB. These belong in `.gitignore` and should be documented in the README as external dependencies.
- **Verify .gitignore**: Before the initial commit of any project, audit `.gitignore` to ensure venvs, caches, build artifacts, and large data are excluded.
