# Genesis — Codebase Onboarding Reconnaissance

> **Role**: Maps an unfamiliar codebase across five stages — structure, history, architecture, governance fitness, and cytogenesis — then produces a persistent Genesis Report artifact and repo-local cells. Stages 1-4 are read-only; Stage 5 is additive only. The output feeds downstream skills (Spores priority, Mycelium blast-radius, Context Pre-Seeding) so the governance system has situational awareness from the first interaction.

## Stages

| Stage | Name | Subagent | Flash Dispatches | Focus |
|:------|:-----|:---------|:----------------:|:------|
| 1 | 🗺️ **Canopy** | Broad Repo Scanner | 1–2 | Tech stack, directory tree, dependencies, entry points, test framework, dev environment probe |
| 2 | 📜 **Rings** | Git History Analyst | 1 | Branch topology, commit frequency, churn heatmap, high-risk files |
| 3 | 📖 **Taproot** | Architecture Analyst | 1–2 | API surface, data models, config patterns, external integrations, cross-repo boundaries |
| 4 | 🧭 **Lichen** | Governance Advisor | 1 | Conventions, test patterns, deployment model, traps, governance config, Context Pre-Seeding |
| 5 | 🧫 **Cytogenesis** | Cell Generator | 1 | Vacuoles (traps), Cell Walls (boundaries), Membranes (overrides), Chloroplasts (personas), Plasmodesmata (connections) |

**Total dispatches**: 5–7 Flash subagents across all stages.

### Stage Selection

Genesis stages are **incremental** — run any subset, in any order. Later stages build on earlier outputs when available but degrade gracefully without them.

| Need | Stages | Dispatches | When to Use |
|:-----|:------:|:----------:|:------------|
| Quick layout | Canopy only | 1–2 | "What is this repo?" — fast directory orientation |
| Risk assessment | Canopy + Rings | 2–3 | "Where are the hot spots?" — churn + structure |
| Architecture audit | Canopy + Taproot | 2–4 | "How is this system designed?" — API and data model mapping |
| Full onboarding | All 5 stages | 5–7 | "Onboard me to this codebase" — complete reconnaissance |
| Governance setup | Lichen + Cytogenesis | 2 | "Configure governance for this project" — re-run synthesis |

---

## Design Invariants

1. **Read-only**: Genesis NEVER modifies the repository. It produces artifacts only — no writes, no commits, no branch creation.
2. **Incremental**: Any single stage can run standalone. Stages build on prior outputs when available but function independently.
3. **Multi-repo**: Accepts multiple repo paths for multi-service architectures. Each repo gets its own stage passes; Lichen synthesizes across all of them.
4. **Cacheable**: Output persists as a governance artifact (`genesis-report-[project].md`). Subsequent runs diff against the previous report and highlight what changed.
5. **Feeds downstream**: Canopy → Context Pre-Seeding. Rings → Spores priority ranking. Taproot → Mycelium blast-radius context. Lichen → governance configuration.

---

## Stage 1: Canopy (Repository Structure Mapping)

Dispatch 1–2 Flash broad repo scanners to map the repository's physical structure.

### Scanner Objectives

| Objective | Method | Output |
|:----------|:-------|:-------|
| Tech stack | Detect language files, framework markers (`next.config.js`, `pom.xml`, `Cargo.toml`) | `{language, framework, build_system, package_manager}` |
| Directory tree | `find` / `fd` with annotated roles | Annotated tree (max 3 levels, role per directory) |
| Dependencies | Parse manifest files (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `build.gradle`, `go.mod`, etc.) | Dependency list with counts (direct vs transitive) |
| Entry points | Identify main classes, `index.*`, `server.*`, `main.*`, CLI entry points | List of entry points with file paths |
| Testing framework | Detect test runners (`jest`, `pytest`, `JUnit`, `go test`), test directories, config files | `{framework, runner_command, test_directory, config_file}` |
| Monorepo detection | Check for workspace configs (`lerna.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, Nx, Turborepo) | `{is_monorepo, workspace_tool, package_count}` |

### Dev Environment Probe

> [!NOTE]
> Local environment blindness is the #4 source of wasted agent steps (120 steps). Canopy supplements repository structure mapping with a sanitized dev environment probe, establishing situational awareness before downstream tools execute build, lint, or test commands.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Privacy Invariant**: All probe outputs must be **sanitized aggregates** — versions and booleans, NOT raw command output.
> - **NO file paths** (especially not `which python3` output, which leaks `/home/<user>/`)
> - **NO usernames** (especially not `git config user.name`, which leaks real names)
> - **NO raw environment variable values** (especially not `$SHELL`, `$TERM_PROGRAM`, `$CODESPACES`, or `$REMOTE_CONTAINERS_IPC`)
> - **NO hostnames** (use `uname -s -m`, never `hostname` or `uname -n`)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Orchestrator Execution Mandate**: Research subagents have **read-only tools only** — probes requiring shell execution must be performed by the parent orchestrator before dispatch. The orchestrator gathers and sanitizes the probe values, then injects the clean aggregate block into the Canopy subagent prompt (or directly records it in the report artifact).

| Probe | Method | Sanitized Output | Must NOT Output |
|:------|:-------|:----------------|:---------------|
| Shell version | `bash --version` | `shell: bash 5.x` | NOT `$SHELL` value |
| OS & arch | `uname -s -m` | `os: linux, arch: x86_64` | NOT hostname |
| Build tools | `command -v make cmake npm cargo go` | `tools: [make, npm, go]` | NOT full paths |
| Container detection | Check `/.dockerenv` existence | `container: false` | NOT env var values |
| IDE context | Check known env vars | `ide: antigravity 2.x` | NOT `$TERM_PROGRAM` raw value |
| Python environment | Check for venv markers | `python: 3.11, venv: true` | NOT `which python3` path |
| Git status | `git --version` | `git: 2.43, configured: true` | NOT `git config user.name` |
| Package managers | `command -v brew apt choco` | `pkg: [apt]` | NOT full paths |

## Stage 5: Cytogenesis (Adaptive Governance Generation)

> **OPTIONAL**: Stage 5 is optional. Genesis can still run stages 1–4 independently without triggering Cytogenesis.
> **INVARIANT**: Cells are additive only — they never override global governance rules.

Dispatch 1 Flash cytogenesis orchestrator to read the Lichen output and generate repo-local immune cells.

Before generating cells from Lichen output, check `templates/` for domain-matching template packs. Detect domain from: `requirements.txt` (Python/ML), `package.json` (JS/web), `Dockerfile`/`*.tf` (infra), `setup.py` with torch/tensorflow (RL/ML). Copy matching templates to `.soma/cells/` as seed cells.

### Orchestrator Objectives

| Objective | Method | Output |
|:----------|:-------|:-------|
| Vacuoles (Traps) | For each identified trap/anti-pattern from Lichen | Generate a Vacuole cell in `.soma/cells/vacuoles/trap-<slugified-name>.md` |
| Vacuoles (Traps) | High density of hardcoded numeric literals (coordinates, ports, timeouts) | Generate a Vacuole cell in `.soma/cells/vacuoles/trap-magic-numbers.md` |
| Cell Walls (Boundaries) | Detect security-sensitive paths (auth/, secrets/, .env files, config/credentials) | Generate a Cell Wall in `.soma/cells/walls/wall-<slugified-name>.md` |
| Membranes (Escalation) | Identify high-risk directories (migrations/, infrastructure/, deploy/) | Generate a Membrane in `.soma/cells/membranes/membrane-<slugified-name>.md` |
| Plasmodesmata (Connections) | Detect multi-service patterns: `pip install -e` references to sibling repos, shared database connections, event bus channels, protobuf/gRPC imports, API client libraries importing from other repos | Generate a Plasmodesmata cell in `.soma/cells/plasmodesmata/<connection-name>.md` |

## Stage 5: Cytogenesis (Adaptive Immune Cell Generation)

Dispatch 1 Flash cell generator to convert Lichen's synthesis into persistent immune cells.

### Generator Objectives

| Objective | Method | Output |
|:----------|:-------|:-------|
| Chloroplast generation | Analyze tech stack, API patterns, data models, test patterns, and dependency types | 2-3 repo-specific Personas |

### Chloroplast Personas
Genesis analyzes the repo's domain and generates 2-3 Chloroplast personas. These provide domain expertise that generic personas lack.
- **Analysis inputs**:
  - Tech stack (from Canopy stage)
  - API patterns (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, event-driven)
  - Data models (SQL, NoSQL, file-based, graph)
  - Test patterns (unit-heavy, integration-heavy, E2E)
  - Dependency types (monorepo, multi-service, standalone)
- **Each Chloroplast file in `.soma/cells/chloroplasts/`**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  type: chloroplast
  persona_name: "<descriptive name>"
  hypothesis: "<what domain expertise this persona brings>"
  prediction: "<what kinds of issues this persona catches>"
  falsification: "0 unique findings in 10 sessions → prune"
  expiry_sessions: 10

  expertise: ["<area1>", "<area2>"]
  fitness:
    triggers: 0
    true_positives: 0
    false_positives: 0
    score: null
  ---
  ## Persona: <name>
  <persona description, what they look for, their expertise>

  ### Review Focus
  - <what this persona prioritizes>
  - <domain-specific patterns they catch>
  ```

---

## Multi-Repo Mode

When provided multiple repository paths, Genesis runs Stages 1–3 independently for each repo, then runs a single Lichen pass that synthesizes across all repositories.

```
genesis([repo_a, repo_b, repo_c])

  Stage 1: Canopy(repo_a), Canopy(repo_b), Canopy(repo_c)  ← parallel
  Stage 2: Rings(repo_a), Rings(repo_b), Rings(repo_c)        ← parallel
  Stage 3: Taproot(repo_a), Taproot(repo_b), Taproot(repo_c)                    ← parallel
  Stage 4: Lichen(all_outputs)                                            ← single synthesis
```

The Lichen stage additionally identifies:
- **Shared contracts** between repos (proto files, OpenAPI specs, shared packages)
- **Deployment coupling** (do repos deploy independently or together?)
- **Cross-repo churn correlation** (do changes in repo_a frequently accompany changes in repo_b?)

---

## Output Format

The Genesis Report is a structured markdown artifact persisted as `genesis-report-[project-name].md`:

```markdown
# Genesis Report — [Project Name]
> Generated: [timestamp] | Stages: [list] | Repos: [count]

## 🗺️ Canopy
[Stage 1 output — tech stack, directory tree, dependencies, entry points, testing]

### Dev Environment
[Sanitized environment aggregates: shell, OS/arch, build tools, container status, IDE, Python/venv, Git status, package managers. Note: Probed by parent orchestrator; research subagents have read-only tools only. Contains zero raw paths, usernames, or env vars.]

## 📜 Rings
[Stage 2 output — branch topology, commit activity, churn heatmap, high-risk files]

## 📖 Taproot
[Stage 3 output — API surface, data models, config patterns, integrations, boundaries]

## 🧭 Lichen
[Stage 4 output — conventions, testing patterns, deployment model, traps, governance config]

## 🧫 Cytogenesis
[Stage 5 output — generated cells]

## Auto-Generated Context Block
[Context pre-seeding block (~200 tokens approx, measured via `token_census.py`) ready for copy-paste into subagent prompts]

---
## Diff from Previous Report
[If a prior genesis-report exists, show what changed since last run]
```

---

## Cache & Diff Behavior

| Scenario | Behavior |
|:---------|:---------|
| First run | Full 4-stage scan, produces `genesis-report-[project].md` |
| Subsequent run (same repo) | Re-runs selected stages, diffs against cached report, highlights changes |
| Subsequent run (new files detected) | Re-runs Canopy + impacted stages, appends diff section |
| Force full refresh | User says "genesis --fresh" or "re-scan everything" — ignores cache |

The diff section uses standard diff formatting:
```diff
## 🗺️ Canopy
- Dependencies: 42 direct, 18 dev
+ Dependencies: 45 direct, 19 dev
  [+3 new: @aws-sdk/client-s3, zod, vitest]
```

---

## Relationship to Existing System

Genesis output feeds directly into multiple downstream skills and prongs:

```

| Taproot | Mycelium | Pre-computed dependency graph accelerates blast-radius analysis |
| Taproot | Security Audit | API surface and external integrations define the attack surface |
| Lichen | Staff Review | Recommended protocol level becomes the session default |
| Lichen | Governance Auditor | Recommended rules are activated for the project |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't modify the repository** — Genesis is strictly read-only reconnaissance. If a stage subagent proposes a fix, discard it. Genesis observes; other skills act.
- **Don't skip Canopy** — All other stages benefit from structure context. Running Rings or Taproot without Canopy produces lower-quality output.
- **Don't run Lichen without at least one prior stage** — Lichen synthesizes; it needs raw data to synthesize. Running Lichen on an empty input produces generic boilerplate.
- **Don't dispatch >2 subagents per stage** — Genesis stages are sequential and focused. Unlike Spores (which benefits from orthogonal lenses), Genesis stages have a single objective each.
- **Don't cache across major version changes** — If the repo undergoes a major refactor (new framework, language migration), force a fresh Genesis run. Diffing against a stale baseline produces misleading deltas.
- **Don't substitute Genesis for a review** — Genesis maps the terrain; it does not evaluate quality. Use Staff Review, Spores, or Adaptive Reviewer to assess code quality.
- **Don't let Lichen subagents apply governance config** — Lichen *recommends* configuration. The orchestrator presents recommendations to the user, who decides what to activate.

## Model Selection

| Role | Model | Rationale |
|:-----|:------|:----------|
| Canopy scanner | `flash` | File-system traversal, manifest parsing, structured output |
| Rings analyst | `flash` | Git command execution, quantitative analysis, heatmap generation |
| Taproot analyst | `flash` | Pattern matching on code (routes, schemas, configs), structured tables |
| Lichen advisor | `flash` | Synthesis of prior outputs, governance recommendation, template generation |
| Report synthesizer | orchestrator (self) | Cross-stage reconciliation, diff generation, artifact persistence |

## When to Use

- **"What is this codebase?"** — Full Genesis (all 4 stages)
- **"Onboard me"** / **"I'm new to this repo"** — Full Genesis + present Context Pre-Seeding block
- **"Map this repo"** / **"Show me the structure"** — Canopy only
- **"Where are the hot spots?"** — Canopy + Rings
- **"How is this system architected?"** — Canopy + Taproot
- **"Set up governance for this project"** — Full Genesis (Lichen needs all prior stages for good recommendations)
- **"What changed since last scan?"** — Re-run Genesis with cache diff

## When NOT to Use

- **Code review** — Use Staff Review or Adaptive Reviewer. Genesis maps; it does not judge.
- **Known defect** — Use Breeze. The bug is already located; no reconnaissance needed.
- **Active debugging** — Use Incident Debug. Genesis is pre-engagement reconnaissance, not live triage.
- **Single-file exploration** — Just read the file. Genesis is for repository-scale mapping.
- **CI/CD pipeline** — Genesis is interactive and conversational. For automated quality gates, use Bedrock as a CI check.
